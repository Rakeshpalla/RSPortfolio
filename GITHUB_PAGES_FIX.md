# 🚨 GitHub Pages 404 Error - SOLUTION

## The Issue:
You're seeing "There isn't a GitHub Pages site here" because GitHub Pages hasn't been enabled yet.

## 🔧 Quick Fix Steps:

### Step 1: Enable GitHub Pages
1. **Go to your repository**: https://github.com/rakeshpalla364-byte/CAREER_PORTFOLIO
2. **Click "Settings"** (top menu of your repository)
3. **Scroll down to "Pages"** section (left sidebar)
4. **Under "Source"**, select **"Deploy from a branch"**
5. **Branch**: Select **"master"** (or "main" if that's your default)
6. **Folder**: Select **"/ (root)"**
7. **Click "Save"**

### Step 2: Wait for Deployment
- GitHub will show: "Your site is being built from the master branch"
- Wait 2-5 minutes for deployment
- Refresh the page to see: "Your site is published at https://rakeshpalla364-byte.github.io/CAREER_PORTFOLIO"

### Step 3: Verify Your Files
Make sure these files are in your repository root:
- ✅ `index.html` (in public folder)
- ✅ `build/` folder with all assets
- ✅ `package.json` with homepage field
- ✅ `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`

## 🚀 Alternative: Use GitHub Actions (Recommended)

If the above doesn't work, let's use GitHub Actions for automatic deployment:

### Enable GitHub Actions:
1. **Go to repository Settings**
2. **Click "Actions"** in left sidebar
3. **Enable "Allow all actions and reusable workflows"**
4. **Go to "Actions" tab** in your repository
5. **Click "Deploy Portfolio to GitHub Pages"**
6. **Click "Run workflow"**

## 🔍 Troubleshooting:

### If still getting 404:
1. **Check repository is Public** (required for free GitHub Pages)
2. **Verify branch name** (might be "main" instead of "master")
3. **Wait 10-15 minutes** for GitHub to process
4. **Clear browser cache** and try again

### If files are missing:
1. **Upload all files** from your project folder
2. **Make sure build folder** is included
3. **Check package.json** has homepage field
