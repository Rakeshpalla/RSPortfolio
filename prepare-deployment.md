# ðŸš€ Quick Deployment Guide

## Current Issue
Your GitHub Pages is showing README.md instead of your portfolio because it's not configured to serve the built React app.

## Immediate Fix (Choose One):

### Option 1: GitHub Actions (Recommended)
1. Go to: https://github.com/rakeshpalla364-byte/CAREER_PORTFOLIO
2. Click "Settings" â†’ "Pages"
3. Change source to "GitHub Actions"
4. Commit the `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file I created
5. Push to main branch - it will auto-deploy

### Option 2: Manual Upload (Fastest)
1. Go to: https://github.com/rakeshpalla364-byte/CAREER_PORTFOLIO
2. Create new branch: `gh-pages`
3. Upload ALL files from your `build` folder to this branch
4. Go to Settings â†’ Pages
5. Set source to "Deploy from a branch" â†’ `gh-pages` branch

### Option 3: Use GitHub Desktop
1. Open GitHub Desktop
2. Clone your repository
3. Run `npm run build:prod` in terminal
4. Copy all files from `build` folder to repository root
5. Commit and push

## Files to Upload (from build folder):
- index.html
- manifest.json
- robots.txt
- sitemap.xml
- static/ folder (with all CSS/JS files)
- All other files in build/

## Expected Result:
Your portfolio should show at: https://rakeshpalla364-byte.github.io/CAREER_PORTFOLIO/
